  <p>
    I am <a href="/"><span itemprop="name">Lautaro Colombo</span></a>, and I can help you start
    your business, build your product, get your first customers and grow a technical team.
    As a non-technical founder, you struggle with translating your vision into working software.
    I can be your <strong itemprop="role">interim CTO</strong>.<!--  in <span itemprop="location">Paris</span>. -->
  </p>

  <p>
    I work as a Web Application Pentester <a href="https://mercadolibre.com">@Mercadolibre</a>. My day to day responsibilities involve, as a hole, making the platform more secure. I focus primarily on Vulnerability Management, Web App Pentesting and Threat Modeling, among others things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Topics that interests me in the field are Web Application Security, Computer and Network Security and Applied Cryptography.

    <b>Also a Sports Guy</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a very big fan of playing and studying the game of football, a sport I played competitively throughout my childhood, adolescence and part of my adulthood. If I'm not talking security, I'm probably talking football.
